A ticket booking platform where organizations can generate their own tickets or customers can buy the tickets. These tickets will contain information about the seat number, price, names etc. Every ticket is unique and hence it is Non-Fungible. We are trying to use the fact that these tickets can be treated as NFTs and be bought, sold and traded on our platform. The setup is in 3 very simple steps and we make it so that it is extremely fast, reliable and very easy. The tickets can also be generated and bought in mass. This is all done with the help of trade of Ether(ETH) and could be backed by Polygon and Ethereum.

## Use Cases
```
#1
I want to book tickets for an event, I can go to the RTM site and book the tickets 
directly and very quickly from there. I am not spending money but I am spending ETH to do so.

#2
AS A person interested in the digital ticketing system and NFTs
I WANT to generate/buy tickets
SO THAT I can book/host events AND use the tickets as NFTs

#3
A famous person, let's say Elon Musk bought a ticket on this platform. Because of Elon Musk's global brand and fame, he can decide to sell this ticket for a high price. So he can use the RTM web application to sell off his ticket as an NFT which sells for a lot of eth. 

#4
I am an organization that wants to generate mass tickets for an event I am organizing soon. I can very easily generate tickets in mass. This makes it easy for me to host events whenever I want for whatever I need.
