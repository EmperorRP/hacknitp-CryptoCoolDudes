We are developing a Ticketing system which creates tickets in the form of NFTs. These tickets will contain information about the seat number, price, names etc. Most importantly, we will also be able to make these tickets in mass. The ticket checking system for NFTs will also be implemented. Additionally, the tickets will be transferable and tradeable amongst users.

## User Story

```
AS A person interested in the digital ticketing system and NFTs
I WANT to generate/buy tickets
SO THAT I can book/host events AND use the tickets as NFTs

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
