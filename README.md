# Rapid Ticketing Marketplace

## Description

We are developing a Ticketing system which creates tickets in the form of NFTs. These tickets will contain information about the seat number, price, names etc. Most importantly, we will also be able to make these tickets in mass. The ticket checking system for NFTs will also be implemented. Additionally, the tickets will be transferable and tradeable amongst users.
